# Project: Data Lake with Spark

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Datasets
We are working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:
- song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
- song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
*{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}*

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Project Files
In addition to the data files, the project workspace also includes 3 files:
- **dl.cfg** Contains the Secret Key for ASW access.
- **etl.py** Loading song data and log data from S3 to Spark, transforms data into a set of dimensional tables, then save the table back to S3.
- **README.md** Provides project info.

### Instruction
- Set key and secrect in dwh.cfg file.
- Use following command to start ETL process **python etl.py**.
